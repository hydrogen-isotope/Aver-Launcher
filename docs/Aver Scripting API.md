Aver Engine — C# Scripting API
The gameplay you write for Aver Engine is C# that runs in-process against the engine's entity/component world. You derive a base type (AverActor, AverPawn, AverCharacter, …), override lifecycle hooks (OnBeginPlay, OnTick, …), and reach the running game through a small, static-first API (Game, Input, and the Entity handle). There is no UObject: a "class" is a row in a native registry, and spawning is a memcpy of that row's defaults — so scripts are thin, and the surface below is all you touch.

This document is the reference for that surface. It lives in Aver.Framework (namespace Aver.Framework); vector maths (Vec3, Quat, Rot) lives in Aver.Scene; the log (Log) lives in Aver.Scripting.

1. Getting started
A gameplay type is a C# class that (a) derives an Aver base type, and (b) carries an [AverClass("Name")] (or [AverGameMode(...)]) attribute naming it. The editor's Content Browser → + Add → New C# Script scaffolds one; a hand-written one looks like this:

using Aver.Framework;
using Aver.Scene;      // Vec3, Rot
using Aver.Scripting;  // Log

namespace MyGame;

[AverClass("BP_Rotator")]
public sealed class Rotator : AverActor
{
    // The class RECIPE — run once per class at load, never per instance. Declares components + tick.
    public static void Configure(ClassBuilder b)
    {
        b.Mesh("Meshes/cube.ocmesh");   // this actor's own entity gets a mesh
        b.Ticks(TickGroup.PrePhysics);  // ask to tick
    }

    private float _angle;

    public override void OnBeginPlay(BeginReason reason) => Log.Info("Rotator started");

    public override void OnTick(float dt)
    {
        _angle += 90f * dt;                              // 90 deg/sec
        Self.SetLocalRotation(new Rot(_angle, 0, 0).ToQuat());
    }
}
How it runs. The editor's Compile C# button (or Tools → Compile Scripts) builds your Content/Scripts into an assembly and hot-swaps it in. At load the host reflects every AverActor-derived type, calls its static Configure(ClassBuilder) (if present) to register the class's defaults, and wires the lifecycle. Pressing Play starts a session (below); your actors' hooks then fire.

Two rules worth knowing up front:

Hooks are virtual overrides, not attributes — a misspelt OnTick is a compile error, not a method that silently never runs.
0 is always invalid. A default Entity is invalid; a lookup that finds nothing returns Entity.None; IsValid/IsAlive tell you.
Logging. Console.WriteLine goes nowhere in the editor's windowed process; write to the engine's Output Log through Aver.Scripting.Log instead: Log.Trace/Info/Warn/Error(string) (and the explicit Log.Write(Log.Level, string)). It falls back to the console when run outside a host.

2. The class hierarchy
AverActor                     the root: a thing in the world with a transform and a lifecycle
├── AverPawn                  an actor that can be POSSESSED by a controller
│   └── AverCharacter         a first/third-person walking pawn (WASD + mouse)
├── AverPlayerController      the will that drives a pawn (possession control)
├── AverGameMode              the rules of a play session (names its pawn + controller)
└── AverGameInstance          process-lifetime state that spans levels
The base type you derive is how the compiler decides which capability flag the class gets (PAWN, CONTROLLER, GAME_MODE, …) and which hooks you may override. AverPlayerController is the one non-abstract base — many games never subclass it and just name "PlayerController" as the controller.

3. The play lifecycle
The world has two lives: EDITOR (authoring) and PLAYING. Pressing Play in the editor calls begin_play, which:

spawns the GameInstance (if the project has one), then the GameMode;
spawns the GameMode's named PlayerController and Pawn, and possesses the pawn;
moves the state to Playing.
Stop calls end_play, which runs every actor's OnEndPlay(EndReason.Stop) and returns the world to EDITOR — clearing every actor a session spawned, not only those four roots. Read the current state and singletons through Game.

The hook order within a frame: begin-play queue drains → OnTick in tick-group order → destroy queue drains. Gameplay ticks only while Playing (a Paused session freezes it without tearing down).

4. Lifecycle hooks
Override these on your AverActor subclass. All are optional; the defaults do nothing.

Hook	When
void OnBeginPlay(BeginReason reason)	Once when the actor begins playing. reason is Spawn (fresh), Play (an already-placed actor entering Play), or Reload (after a hot reload).
void OnTick(float dt)	Every frame the class is scheduled to tick, in its tick group. dt is clamped seconds. Requires b.Ticks(...) in Configure.
void OnEndPlay(EndReason reason)	Once when the actor stops playing. Stop = the world stopped; Destroy = it was destroyed; Reload = the entity stays, only the managed half is rebuilt.
void OnRebound()	After a hot reload rebinds this instance and restores its [Editable] state — re-derive cached state here, not in OnBeginPlay.
void BuildModels(ActorBuilder builder)	protected. Builds the actor's model tree; the editor overrides it in a generated .Designer.cs. Hand code rarely writes this.
Pawn-only hooks (AverPawn): OnPossessed(Entity controller), OnUnpossessed(). GameMode-only hook (AverGameMode): OnPostLogin(Entity controller).

Exceptions never cross back into the engine. A throw out of any hook is caught, logged, and that one actor is disabled for the session; the process and every other actor survive.

5. Actors, Pawns, Characters, Controllers, GameMode
AverActor
The root type. Every actor has public Entity Self { get; } — its entity handle (you read it, never assign it). See Spawning for the Spawn/Destroy members.

AverPawn : AverActor
Adds possession. public Entity Controller, public T? ControllerAs<T>(), public bool IsPossessed, and the OnPossessed/OnUnpossessed hooks.

AverCharacter : AverPawn
A first/third-person walking character.

Member	Description
public float MoveSpeed	Ground move speed, cm/s (default 350).
public float TurnSpeed	Mouse-look sensitivity, degrees of yaw per pixel (default 0.2).
public CameraView CameraViewMode	FirstPerson or ThirdPerson (default third).
public float EyeHeight	First-person eye height, cm (default 160).
public float BoomLength	Third-person camera distance behind, cm (default 450).
public float Yaw { get; }	The character's facing yaw, degrees (read-only; turned by DriveWithInput, set by SetYaw).
protected void DriveWithInput(float dt)	One frame of WASD-walk + mouse-turn control; call from OnTick while possessed. Kinematic (no physics yet).
protected void SetYaw(float degrees)	Snap the facing yaw without the mouse having moved it.
AverPlayerController : AverActor
The will that drives a pawn. See Possession.

AverGameMode : AverActor
The rules for a play session. Names its pawn/controller by string on [AverGameMode]. Adds virtual void OnPostLogin(Entity controller) — fires once the controller has entered.

AverGameInstance : AverActor
Process-lifetime state that spans levels. Adds nothing over AverActor; the concept it contributes is lifetime. Reach it with Game.Instance.

6. Entity — the handle to a thing in the world
Entity is a readonly struct — a 32-bit key into the world's component arrays. default is invalid. Transform writes are methods (not property setters) because it is returned by value.

Identity

Member	Description
int Handle	The raw ABI handle (0 = invalid).
static Entity None	The invalid handle.
bool IsValid	Handle != 0.
bool IsAlive	The handle still addresses a live entity.
bool IsActor	A gameplay class owns this entity (vs a plain scene entity).
ActorClass Class	The class this entity is an instance of.
string Name / void SetName(string)	The display name.
ulong ObjectId	The persisted identity (fnv1a64 of the name), survives serialisation.
AverActor? Actor / T? As<T>()	The live managed instance bound to this entity, or null.
void Destroy()	Destroy this entity (full framework teardown if it's an actor).
Transform (local, centimetres; rotation as a quaternion — compose in degrees via Rot)

Member	Description
Vec3 LocalPosition / void SetLocalPosition(Vec3) / void Translate(Vec3 delta)	Local position.
Quat LocalRotation / void SetLocalRotation(Quat)	Local rotation.
Vec3 LocalScale / void SetLocalScale(Vec3)	Local scale.
Vec3 Forward / Right / Up	Local axes (+X / +Y / +Z), rotated by the local rotation.
Vec3 WorldPosition	World-space position, composed through parents.
Vec3 WorldForward / WorldRight / WorldUp	World-space axes, normalised.
Hierarchy

Member	Description
Entity Parent / Entity FirstChild / Entity NextSibling / int ChildCount	Links.
IEnumerable<Entity> Children	Immediate children, in order.
bool SetParent(Entity parent) / bool Detach()	Reparent (Entity.None → root) / detach. Refuses a cycle.
Components (see the Component enum)

Member	Description
bool HasComponent(Component) / bool AddComponent(Component)	Query / attach (idempotent).
bool Visible / bool SetVisible(bool)	Mesh visibility (adds a mesh renderer if absent).
bool SetMesh(string path) / bool SetMaterial(string name)	Set the drawn mesh / material.
Tags (a 32-bit mask the gameplay layer gives meaning to — define your own bit constants)

Member	Description
uint Tags / bool SetTags(uint)	The whole mask.
bool HasTag(uint) / bool HasAnyTag(uint)	All bits set / any bit set.
bool AddTag(uint) / bool RemoveTag(uint)	Set / clear bits.
Generic component fields (by qualified name, e.g. "CLight.intensityLux" — works for [Editable] fields and any component field)

float GetFloat(string) · bool SetFloat(string, float) · int GetInt(string) · bool SetInt(string, int) · long GetInt64(string) · bool SetInt64(string, long) · Vec3 GetVec3(string) · bool SetVec3(string, Vec3) · string GetString(string) · bool SetString(string, string)

7. Game — the running session
Static. In EDITOR every handle is Entity.None and State is Editor. Read-only: starting/stopping a session is the editor's job, not a script's.

State

Member	Description
PlayState State	Editor / Playing / Paused.
bool IsPlaying / bool IsPaused / bool HasSession	Playing / paused / a session exists (playing OR paused).
Session singletons (each Entity, with a typed …As<T>() counterpart)

Member	Typed
Entity Mode	T? ModeAs<T>() where T : AverGameMode
Entity Instance	T? InstanceAs<T>() where T : AverGameInstance
Entity LocalPlayerController / Entity GetPlayerController(int i = 0)	T? PlayerControllerAs<T>(int i = 0)
Entity GetPlayerPawn(int i = 0)	T? PlayerPawnAs<T>(int i = 0) where T : AverPawn
Lookup & iteration (each a linear scan taken this frame — don't spawn/destroy while enumerating)

Member	Description
Entity Find(string name) / T? FindActor<T>(string name)	Resolve an actor by name.
IEnumerable<Entity> AllActors()	Every live actor.
IEnumerable<T> ActorsOf<T>()	Every live actor whose instance is a T.
IEnumerable<Entity> WithTag(uint mask)	Every entity carrying all of mask.
Actors.Get(Entity) / Actors.Get<T>(Entity) are the lower-level resolvers Entity.As<T> is built on.

8. Input
Static, polled, Unity-style. The editor pushes the frame's device state each tick (suppressed while a text field has focus). Read it from OnTick.

Member	Description
bool GetKey(Key k)	Held.
bool GetKeyDown(Key k) / bool GetKeyUp(Key k)	Went down / up this frame.
float MouseDeltaX / MouseDeltaY / MouseWheel	This frame's mouse movement / wheel.
Vec3 MoveAxis	WASD/arrows as (forward, right, 0); not normalised.
Key values: A–Z, D0–D9, Space, LeftShift, LeftCtrl, LeftAlt, Enter, Escape, Tab, Left, Right, Up, Down, MouseLeft, MouseRight, MouseMiddle.

9. Spawning and destroying
Spawn is protected static on AverActor (call from within an actor). The typed forms return the live instance (or null if the class isn't declared); the ActorClass forms return the Entity.

Member	Description
Entity Spawn(ActorClass c, Vec3 at)	Spawn a class chosen at runtime.
Entity Spawn(ActorClass c, Vec3 at, Rot rotation)	…with orientation.
Entity Spawn(ActorClass c, Vec3 at, Rot rotation, Vec3 scale)	…with a full transform.
T? Spawn<T>(Vec3 at)	Spawn T, return the instance.
T? Spawn<T>(Vec3 at, Rot rotation) / T? Spawn<T>(Vec3 at, Rot rotation, Vec3 scale)	…with orientation / full transform.
T? SpawnAttached<T>(Entity parent, Vec3 localPosition)	Spawn as a child of parent; returns null if the attach is rejected (and cleans up).
void Destroy()	Destroy this actor now (fires OnEndPlay).
static void Destroy(Entity other) / static void Destroy(AverActor? other)	Destroy another.
ActorClass — the Spawn<T> forms name the class by type; the Spawn(ActorClass, …) forms take a class handle, for when the class is chosen at runtime. Get one with ActorClass.Find("BP_Coin") (an invalid handle if no such class is declared — check IsValid); Entity.Class gives the class an entity is an instance of. An ActorClass is a readonly struct with int Handle, bool IsValid, and string Name (0 == invalid).

ActorClass coin = ActorClass.Find("BP_Coin");
if (coin.IsValid)
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        Spawn(coin, new Vec3(i * 100f, 0f, 20f));   // class picked at runtime
10. Possession
On AverPlayerController:

Member	Description
Entity Possessed / T? PossessedAs<T>() / bool HasPawn	The controlled pawn.
bool Possess(Entity pawn) / bool Possess(AverPawn pawn)	Take control. A pawn already driven by another controller is stolen (it gets OnUnpossessed then OnPossessed); re-possessing the pawn you already drive is a no-op that returns true.
bool Unpossess()	Release the current pawn.
On the pawn side, AverPawn.Controller / ControllerAs<T>() / IsPossessed read the inverse, straight from the world (never cached).

11. Attributes
Attribute	Use
[AverClass("Name")]	Names a gameplay class. Optional Parent = "…" (inferred from the base type otherwise).
[AverGameMode("Name")]	Names a GameMode. DefaultPawnClass = "…", PlayerControllerClass = "…" name (by string) the pawn and controller it spawns.
[Editable]	A field editable in the Details panel and stored in native storage (survives Play/Stop and hot reload). Optional Min / Max.
[Model]	Marks a model-tree field the editor manages.
12. Enums
Enum	Values
BeginReason	Spawn (0), Play (1), Reload (2)
EndReason	Destroy (0), Stop (1), Reload (2), Travel (3)
TickGroup	PrePhysics (0), Physics (1), PostPhysics (2)
PlayState	Editor (0), Playing (1), Paused (2)
CameraView	FirstPerson, ThirdPerson
Component	Local (1), World (2), Hierarchy (3), Name (4), Tags (5), MeshRenderer (6), Light (7), Camera (8)
13. ClassBuilder and ActorBuilder
ClassBuilder writes a class's defaults — the recipe run once per class, in static void Configure(ClassBuilder b):

Member	Description
void Mesh(string meshPath, string material = "")	Give the class's own entity a mesh (and optional material).
void PointLight(float intensityLux, float rangeCm)	Add a point light.
void Camera(float fovDegrees, float nearCm, float farCm)	Add a camera.
void Ticks(TickGroup group, int order = 0)	Ask the class to tick, in group.
ActorBuilder writes the editor-owned model tree inside BuildModels; hand code rarely touches it. ModelHandle is the handle a placed model returns.

14. Maths — Vec3, Quat, Rot
In Aver.Scene (centimetres; +X forward, +Y right, +Z up; left-handed).

Vec3 — float X, Y, Z; new Vec3(x, y, z); statics Forward (1,0,0), Right (0,1,0), Up (0,0,1), Zero, One; + - * operators.
Quat — float X, Y, Z, W; static Identity; Quat.FromAxisAngle(Vec3 axis, float radians); *.
Rot — degrees a viewport gizmo edits: float Yaw (about up), Pitch (about right), Roll (about forward); new Rot(yaw, pitch, roll); Rot.Zero; Quat ToQuat().
15. Worked examples
A player character (WASD + mouse, first/third person)
[AverClass("BP_Hero")]
public sealed class Hero : AverCharacter
{
    public static void Configure(ClassBuilder b)
    {
        b.Mesh("Meshes/hero.ocmesh");
        b.Ticks(TickGroup.PrePhysics);
    }

    public override void OnTick(float dt)
    {
        DriveWithInput(dt);                                    // WASD walks, mouse turns
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(Key.V))                           // V toggles the view
            CameraViewMode = CameraViewMode == CameraView.ThirdPerson
                ? CameraView.FirstPerson : CameraView.ThirdPerson;
    }
}
A GameMode that hands out that character
[AverGameMode("BP_GameMode", DefaultPawnClass = "BP_Hero", PlayerControllerClass = "PlayerController")]
public sealed class MyGameMode : AverGameMode
{
    public override void OnPostLogin(Entity controller) =>
        Log.Info($"{controller.Name} logged in, driving {controller.As<AverPlayerController>()?.Possessed.Name}");
}
A spawner that scatters pickups and tags them
[AverClass("BP_Spawner")]
public sealed class Spawner : AverActor
{
    const uint Pickup = 0x1;

    public override void OnBeginPlay(BeginReason reason)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Coin? c = Spawn<Coin>(new Vec3(i * 100f, 0f, 20f));
            c?.Self.AddTag(Pickup);
        }
        Log.Info($"{System.Linq.Enumerable.Count(Game.WithTag(Pickup))} pickups in the world");
    }
}

[AverClass("BP_Coin")]
public sealed class Coin : AverActor
{
    public static void Configure(ClassBuilder b) => b.Mesh("Meshes/coin.ocmesh");
}
16. Not yet available
The gameplay object model above is complete. These are separate subsystems that do not exist yet — a script cannot use them, and a character does not (for example) collide or fall:

Physics / collision — movement is kinematic; there is no gravity, collision or stepping.
Input bindings — input is raw polling (Input.GetKey), not a remappable action/axis map.
Audio, timers / coroutines, UI (in-game), networking.
Hot-reload state migration beyond [Editable] fields.
A converting asset importer — the Content Browser's Import copies files in; it does not convert FBX/PNG into engine formats. Meshes referenced by Mesh("…") resolve against the built-in primitives and (eventually) a real .ocmesh loader.
These are the natural next layers; the object model is the foundation they plug into.
